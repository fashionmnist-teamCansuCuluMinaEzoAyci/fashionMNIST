# FashionMNIST Classification — Model1 & Model2 

This repository contains two convolutional neural network models trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.  
The goal of this project is to classify Fashion-MNIST images into 10 clothing categories and compare two different deep learning model approaches.

This work was completed as part of the **SEN4107 — Introduction to Neural Networks Project**.
